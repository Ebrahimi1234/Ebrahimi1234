<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Reza Ebrahimi</h1>
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you will find a collection of my data science projects, code snippets, and resources related to data science.

About Me
I am a data scientist with 2 years of experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I am passionate about finding insights and solutions in data, and enjoy learning new techniques and tools to enhance my skills.

Projects
Here are some of my notable data science projects:

Heart Disease Prediction: The project was done through fieldwork relating to traditional machine-learning
techniques for classification. The heart disease prediction system predicts whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed
with heart disease or not using the medical history of the patient with different algorithms of machine learning such
as logistic regression and KNN to predict and classify the patient with heart disease.

Disaster Tweet Classification Using Machine Learning: The project was done through several supervised
classification models, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and
Logistic Regression. It can be properly determined if a piece of information(tweet text) is related to a real disaster
or not by applying knowledge and skills in the field of data analysis and machine learning.


Skills
Programming languages: Python, R, SQL, Java, etc.

Data analysis tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, etc.

Data visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, etc.

Machine learning algorithms: Regression, Classification, Clustering, etc.

Deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.

Cloud platforms: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.

Blog
I regularly share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences related to data science on my blog. Check it out <a href="https://kabultechnology.blogspot.com/2021/11/what-is-python-python-is-popular.html" target="_blank">here</a> .
